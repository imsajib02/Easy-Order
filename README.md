# Easy-Order - A lot of times it happens that customers have to sit and wait for the waiter to come and take their order. Most of the time, itâ€™s really annoying. To get rid of this problem I thought of an idea of developing an app, which may be different based on the different restaurant requirements.
After entering a restaurant, customers will be provided with this app and they can make their order using this app adding the table number they are sitting. After ordering, the order will be stored in the database and from there the restaurant management team can take this order and deliver the food to that table.
