# EasyOrder
A conceptual food ordering application. Developed this for my own development practice. It has necessary functionalitties to show how it will operate. It can be categorized as a `General` application. Not intended for any specific company or restaurent. It is integrated with `Firbase Realtime Database`. The order is placed on the database. Since I developed it for my own practice, it does not has any `Payment Gateway`.
